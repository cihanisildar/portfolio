# Where I’m Most Productive

## 1. **Frameworks (Next.js & React)**  
Although I’ve only been working with **React** since 2022 and **Next.js** since 2023, these frameworks have become the foundation of my web development work. I always start projects with **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and maintainability.

On the frontend, I make use of **React 19 features** like **Server Actions** and **useActionState** to handle forms and user interactions. For data validation, I rely on **Zod** to ensure everything is type-safe and accurate.

## 2. **Styling (Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui)**  
For UI styling, I rely on a combination of **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS** to create flexible, accessible designs.

- **shadcn/ui** offers unstyled components that are easy to customize, helping me design scalable and accessible user interfaces.
  
- **Tailwind CSS** allows me to colocate styles with my markup, making development faster and more organized. It also integrates well with modern AI tools, making code generation and styling more efficient.

## 3. **Backend (Node.js)**  
On the backend, I leverage **Node.js** for its scalability and performance. Paired with **Express.js**, I build robust RESTful APIs. When it comes to real-time communication, **Socket.io** helps me implement features like live updates or notifications.

Type safety remains a priority, so I use **TypeScript** on the server side as well, reducing runtime errors and ensuring consistency across my API.

## 4. **Database (Postgres & MongoDB)**  
I use both **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**, depending on the data needs of my projects:

- **PostgreSQL** is my go-to for structured, relational data. Its support for complex queries and transactions makes it perfect for large-scale, schema-based projects. I often use **TypeORM** or **Prisma** to keep things type-safe and efficient in my TypeScript-based projects.

- **MongoDB** is my preferred choice for projects that need flexible, document-based data storage. Its JSON-like document model fits naturally into my JavaScript workflows. I usually use **Mongoose** for managing schemas and relationships in MongoDB.

This mix of databases allows me to choose the best fit for each project, whether I need the reliability of **Postgres** or the flexibility of **MongoDB**.

## 5. **AI Integration (v0 & Claude)**  
AI tools are a key part of my development workflow. I use **v0** for tasks like refactoring, debugging, and restructuring code, saving me a lot of time when working on large projects.

Additionally, I integrate **Claude** into my workflow to assist with more complex tasks like brainstorming solutions, generating boilerplate code, and even reviewing existing code for improvements. Claude’s advanced language capabilities help streamline my development process by providing smart, context-aware suggestions.

Though AI tools aren’t perfect, their growing understanding of technologies like **Next.js**, **React**, and **Node.js** makes them indispensable for optimizing productivity.
